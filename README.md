# JellEX

Sync watched state between Jellyfin and PLEX!

## Description

Keep in sync all your users watched history between jellyfin and plex servers locally. This uses the imdb ids and any other matching tags to find the correct episode/movie between the two. This is not perfect but it works for most cases. You can use this for as many servers as you want by enterying multiple options in the .env plex/jellyfin section seperated by commas.
